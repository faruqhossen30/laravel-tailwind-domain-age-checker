                About Domain Age Checker.
             </h1>
            <p class="text-lg">A domain age checker is a tool used to determine the age of a domain name, which is essentially the amount of time that has passed since the domain was
                first registered. These tools are beneficial for various reasons, such as SEO optimization, domain valuation, and digital marketing. Here's a detailed overview of what
                these tools are, how they work, and their benefits:</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What is a Domain Age Checker?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg">A domain age checker is an online utility that allows users to find out the registration date of a particular domain name. This information can help
                assess the credibility, trustworthiness, and SEO potential of a website.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How Do Domain Age Checkers Work?</h2>

                <li><strong>WHOIS Lookup:</strong> The tool queries the WHOIS database, which stores information about domain registrations, including the creation date, expiry date,
                    and registrar details.</li>
                <li><strong>Result Display:</strong> The tool displays the age of the domain along with other relevant information like the exact registration date and sometimes the
                    history of the domain ownership.</li>
